## General Information
- PriceGuesser is spinoff of the popular web game GeoGuesser. Players have five round to guess the price of a given piece of clothing from fast fashion. The closer the guess is to the actual price the more points a player will score for that given round. After five round the total points are added up for the final score. Try it today!
- This project gave me experience with frontend web development, backend RESTful-APIs, UX/UI design and implementation, web-scraping in python, database operations, and much more!
